I'm passionate about technology! I had my first contact with computers when I was 7 years old and since then I've been discovering a little more about this wonderful area, I like the opportunity that technology offers people, and the proposal to make people's lives easier, I have a dream of getting to know the whole world sharing all my knowledge and also acquiring new experiences and experiences, I think that knowledge is something everyone should have access to, and I wanted to have the experience of living in Africa for a while.

I have knowledge in: JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, AWS, Serverless, DynamoDB, GraphQL, React, Gatsby, Python, MongoDB, MySQL, HTML, CSS, GIT, Linux, MacOS, Windows.

I have a community called Guia Dev Brazil that helps people in the computing area, whose purpose is to make free and quality content available to the whole world and introduce more people in the area of technology, in the community there are several repositories to help and guide people in its development path, I love to know new things, work in groups and have new experiences, I want to work outside Brazil, improve my English and meet new cultures, people and have new experiences, currently I also study computer science and I dedicate myself to becoming a full-stack developer and cybersecurity specialist.

Let's have a coffee, I'm always open to learn new things and discuss crazy ideas. You can reach me at arthurguiadev@gmail.com
